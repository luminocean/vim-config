# Installation

Make sure you have a recent VIM build 
> Needs to be later that 7.4.45 since YouCompleteMe relys on it.
> If you are using Mac, the vim might be quite old.
> A clever choice is to install a MacVim and alias the console app comes with it to 'vim' 

Run the following commands:
```
# install Vundle
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

# clone this repo and copy .vimrc to your home folder
# ...

vim # and inside VIM run :PluginInstall to install all the plugins
```

And you are ready to go!
